                    Patient
                    Information resulting from such review process. MyMediTales makes no effort to review the Patient
                    Information for any other purpose, including, but not limited to, accuracy, legality or
                    non-infringement. MyMediTales is not responsible for any Patient Information provided by third-party
                    providers or their patient portal sites. MyMediTales cannot guarantee or assume responsibility for
                    the
                    completeness, timeliness, accuracy, relevance, deletion or non-delivery of any Patient Information.

                    <br><br> Your right to access and use the Service is personal to you and is not transferable by you
                    to any other person or entity. You are only entitled to access and use the Service for lawful
                    purposes. Accurate information enables MyMediTales to provide the Service to you. You must provide
                    true, accurate, current and complete information and may not misrepresent information (a) in your
                    registration information, (b) about your family members or third-party providers, or (c) about your
                    Patient Information. In order for the Service to function effectively, you must also keep such
                    information listed above up-to-date and accurate. If you do not do this, the accuracy and
                    effectiveness of the Service will be affected.

                    <br><br> Your access and use of the Service may be interrupted from time to time for any of several
                    reasons, including, without limitation, unanticipated system failures, the malfunction of equipment,

                    MyMediTales
